# PULSE EMF Therapy
This repository contains the Final Powerpoint presentation that was presented to the STEM Path to MBA faculty and NASA representatives. This presentation displays the business model that we created using a NASA patent through NASA's T2U Initiative.

## What is an Innovation Project?
As a part of the STEM Path to MBA curriculum, students are expected to complete two to three Innovation Projects per semester beginning in the first semester of freshman year. Over the course of these Innvation Projects, students in the STEM Path are expected to become extremely proficient in developing a business idea, performing customer segment research, developing a business model canvas, and presenting the findings and business model to the cohort.

## NASA Innovation Project Premise
Each spring semester, the STEM Path cohort completes an Innovation Project utilizing a piece of intellectual property in NASA's Technology Transfer University (T2U) to create a business model in a short period of about 5 weeks. In these weeks, students are tasked with conducting proper consumer research and interviewing members of the identified customer segment. At the end of the Innovation Project presentations, each STEM Path instructor picks a select few groups that they felt were the best, most viable plans among all class sections. Among all instructors, 24 total groups out of approximately 170 are chosen to present in front of all STEM Path faculty and a select group of NASA engineers. Among these 24 groups, different awards are given.

## Customer Segment Research
Over the 5 week period, groups are expected to conduct customer segment research to fill out the business model canvas and determine value propositions. For our group, most of our interviews were of doctors and individuals with degenerative joint issues as our business plan involved selling electromagnetic field therapy to spur joint regeneration as present in the NASA patent No. 10,724,030 B2. Through these interviews, we were able to develop the cost structure, revenue streams, key partners, key activities, customer relationships, and channels. Additionally, we were able to develop an ecosystem map to display the key partners, key activities, and revenue streams.

## Results
Our group was chosen as among the top 14 of the 170 original teams after an effective presentation to NASA employees and the STEM Path faculty, and we received a Silver Award.
